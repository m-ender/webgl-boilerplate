=================

Some useful baseline code to get new WebGL projects quickly up-and-running.

## How to...

You'll need **node.js** and **npm** to test the site locally.

 1. Install dependencies:

        npm install

 2. Start the node.js server

        node server

 3. Open `localhost:1620` in your browser. You can change the port in `server.js` if you want to use a different one.
